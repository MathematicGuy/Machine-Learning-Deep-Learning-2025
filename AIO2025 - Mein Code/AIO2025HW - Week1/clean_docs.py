Module: text
    This module defines classes representing birds and their flying behavior.
    It demonstrates method overriding and the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) violation
    by showing how an Ostrich, which cannot fly, overrides the fly method of its parent Bird class.
    Classes:
        Bird: Represents a generic bird with a fly method.
        Ostrich: Represents an ostrich, a bird that cannot fly, overriding the fly method.

Functions:
    make_it_fly(bird: Bird): Calls the fly method on a given Bird instance.
